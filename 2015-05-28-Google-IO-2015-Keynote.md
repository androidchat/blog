<p><h2>Android M Preview</h2></p>
<p>Google has just made the next version of Android official. Where Android 5.0 Lollipop introduced a new design and interface, M appears to be focused on improving the stability and usability of the software. There are six new topics Google has focused on with Android M.</p>

<p><strong>App Permissions</strong></p>
<p>In Android M, Google redesigned its permissions system. Users will be able to approve or deny security permissions such as location access, camera access and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Web Experience</strong></p>
<p>Google also revamped the web browsing experience with Google Chrome browser. A new feature called “Chrome Custom Tabs” lets developers insert webviews directly into their apps. Chrome features like automatic sign-in, saved passwords, autofill and multi-process security are now available to app developers within their apps.</p>
<p><strong>App Links</strong></p>
<p>The built-in app linking system ( intents ) is also getting an upgrade, allowing apps to open contect directly instead of in a dialog box every time.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Payments</strong></p>
<p>Google also introduced a new payment system called Android Pay. It uses NFC and Host Card Emulation. This feature works with any device running on KitKat and newer operating systems.</p>
<p><strong>Fingerprint Support</strong></p>
<p>Android Pay will also support fingerprint scanning for single tap payments to fill in credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Power and Charging</strong></p>
<p>Google promises better battery life and efficiency with every new version of Android. Android M will get a new feature called Doze, which lets the system better manage background processes. The system relies on motion detection to determine when someone is using the device. Google also promises faster charging with USB type C.</p>
