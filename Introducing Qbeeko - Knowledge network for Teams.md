# Qbeeko - Knowledge network for teams

Qbeeko is a knowledge network for teams. Qbeeko makes it insanely easy to build your team's knowledge base, discuss topics, post questions and contribute to solutions.

Building your team's knowledge base on Qbeeko involves posting messages, questions and solutions, and sharing links to useful articles and documents(both internal and external) with `Channels` and `Private Groups`. People can Comment and Vote on the content shared to discuss the post and make the post more visible.

Qbeeko divides your knowledge base into two spaces:

* `Channels` - Space where information is collected based on topics. Channels make the *Information Space*.
* `Private Groups` - Space where the information collected is used to solve specific problems and generate a variety of innovative solutions. Groups make the *Solution Space*.

###Integrations - Slack, Facebook, Dropbox, Google Drive, Box and more..

Qbeeko is integrated with Slack Login(for teams) and Facebook Login(for individuals). 

You can now integrate Qbeeko with your Slack Team Application through Webhooks. A Qbeeko Channel or Group can be integrated with multiple Groups/Channels on Slack. You will be notified on Slack(Channel/Group where the Webhook links to) when users post anything on a Qbeeko Group or Channel. This way you can make sure that the important things shared by your team are all in one place, and easily accessible. This way, you'll never miss out on the important stuff shared by your Slack team.

Qbeeko is also integrated with Dropbox, Box and Google Drive and users can easily share files with their network from their favorite Cloud Storage services.
