<p>[=First and foremost, we are glad you asked! AndroidChat is run on <a href="https://slack.com" target="_blank">Slack</a>. Slack is a messaging system &amp; platform for communication. Members can send messages and files to each other and also into shared channels of communication on specific topics. You can find out more in the <a href="https://slack.com/is" target="_blank">Slack product tour</a>. We encourage you to install the slack desktop software and phone software. =]</p><p><b>How Can I Contribute to AndroidChat</b></p><p>AndroidChat is dedicated to being community driven. Our theme and blog files are hosted on GitHub and our members are encouraged to contribute. If you would like to promote your latest Android App, please create a blog posts here: <a href="https://github.com/androidchat/blog" target="_blank">AndroidChat GitHub Blog repository</a>. If you would like to share knowledge about Android Development, we'd love your help, please make a pull requests on our <a href="https://github.com/androidchat/blog" target="_blank">AndroidChat GitHub Blog repository</a>. (Please feel free to provide links back to your own websites, so that our members can find more of your content / apps if they enjoy it). If you think the theme could use an upgrade or change, please make a pull request on our <a href="https://github.com/androidchat/theme" target="_blank">AndroidChat GitHub Theme repository.</a> </p><p><strong>Does AndroidChat Make Money?</strong></p><p>Another question we are glad you asked. At this time, AndroidChat is very new and not currently participating in any advertising platform(Google Adsense, Carbon, etc). At this times our plans on monetization are pretty small. Our ultimate goal would be to offset any administration costs to running this website and chat. We would love to get the chat to a place where we can turn a profit, and then turn that profit back to our members through contests, give-aways, and more. Our members make the chat great, so it's important to us that we create a sense of community. </p><p>Should we ever start monetizing this chat, we plan to be open about the earnings and showcase a spreadsheet of where the funds are used. As I've said before, the members make the chat great and we want to reward them for their greatness with contests, prizes and transparency on our part. </p><p><b>How Can I Make an Announcement in the Slack Chat?</b></p><p>We have a channel dedicated to announcements. If you would like to announce your app, find beta testers, promote a job or do anything else please feel free to get in touch with on of our site administrators. The best way to contact us is either through Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/chattyandroids" target="_blank">Chatty Androids</a>, or join the chat and message one of us: <a href="https://androidchat.slack.com/team/smayzes/">Shawn</a>, <a href="https://androidchat.slack.com/team/flm/">Flemming</a> or <a href="https://androidchat.slack.com/team/nicholeous/">Nicole</a>. </p><p>We are looking forward to seeing you in chat and talking about the best Android has to offer!!</p>
